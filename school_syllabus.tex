\qOne{Do we need deep skills in Mathematics?}
\aOne{Yes, we do actually dissect fish. If you know of any issues that may cause you difficulties during dissections, please notify your TA ASAP.}

\qTwo{Do we need deep skills in Computer Programming?}
\aTwo{No clue. When someone says `fish', we have a picture of a general fish of a general shape in our minds, but the truth is that `fish' doesn't have scientific meaning. Here's a funny video about that: \href{https://youtu.be/uhwcEvMJz1Y}{Youtube (hyperlink)}. }

\qThree{What is your favorite fish?}
\aThree{A lumpsucker. They are incredibly, adorably weird-looking.}

\qFour{What's the difference between plural `fish' and `fishes'?}
\aFour{`Fish' is the plural form when talking about two or more fish of the same species. `Fishes' is the plural when talking about two or more different species.}

\section{Overview}

This school is aimed at young students looking to adquire skills on the most trending techniques in mathematical and computational modeling. We place a strong emphasis in practical applications in science and engineering, with a focus on modeling spatiotemporal variations of physical quantities using partial differential equations (PDEs). And related topics such as numerical optimization, playing a vital role today in fields like deep learning.

% This school is oriented to young students interested in gaining skills on the most trending techniques in mathematical and computational modeling. We place a strong emphasis on real-world applications in science and engineering, particularly in topics related to modeling the spatiotemporal variations of physical quantities using partial differential equations (PDEs). 
%We also cover related topics such as numerical optimization.


% This school is oriented to young students interested in gaining skills on the most trending techniques in mathematical and computational modeling. We emphasize practical applications in science and engineering, particullary through models representing space time variations of physcal magnitudes in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs).

% This school is devoted to introducing young students interested in mathematical and computational modeling into some of the most trending techniques being used today in this field. With special interest in practical application to science and engineering of models formulated in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs).

The school is structured into three courses. 
%Two of them focus on computing numerical solutions of PDEs. 
Two of them cover the widely used finite element method (FEM) and other emerging techniques such as physically informed neural networks (PINN) for computing numerical solutions of PDEs.
A third course focus on numerical methods for constrained and unconstrained optimization. 
In these courses, we introduce fundamental math structures, provide illustrative examples, review algorithms, program them with high-level open-source tools, and post-process the solutions for high-quality plotting.
%During these courses, we introduce fundamental mathematical structures, provide illustrative examples and review algorithms, which are programed using high-level open-source computer tools, ultimately obtaining numerical solutions which are post-processed for high-quality plotting.
%The school will be structured around three courses. where, in order to approach the solution of PDEs we will combine some of the most successful techniques used in the last years and other emerging techniques such as physically informed neural networks.
%Along these courses we introduce the basic mathematical structures,  propose several examples and review numerous algorithms. They they program them, using high level open source computer tools, we obtain numerical solutions which are post-processed for obtaining high-quality plotting. 

The necessary mathematical and computer skills will be standardized in introductory online sessions, with the entire learning process overseen by expert professors in the field.
%The required mathematical and computer skills will be standarized in introductory online sessions and the entire learning process will be supervised by professors who are experts in this field. 
The courses are complemented by some conferences where lecturers related to SEA-EU universities  introduce recent research projects related to the subjects of the School.

%It will be structured around three courses where some of the some of the more succesful techniques    the  variational formulation of PDEs and the Finite Element Method (FEM). Using high level open source computer tools, we explore techniques for meshing of spatial domains, numerical solving of systems of equations and post-processing the solutions with high-quality visualization engines. The required mathematical and computer skills will be standardized in the first introductory sessions.

%Topics like thermal diffusion, linear or nonlinear elasticity, migration of biological cells, fluid dynamics in oceanography or naval engineering and many other matters of practical interest will be covered.
%The course is complemented by some conferences in which lecturers related to SEA-EU universities show their experience in recent research projects related to these subjects.

\section{Methodology}

The school begins with a phase dedicated to homogenizing the students' knowledgen to help them reach a basic level before the classroom courses begin to develop in Split. It will be designed as 5 online days where students will be able to access material specifically prepared for them to acquire basic math and computer skills. During these days they will have the support and tutoring of the curses instructors, through video meetings and forums in a virtual campus.

In a second week, the School will be held physically on the premises of the University of Split. It will consist on three courses where  theoretical lectures will be given by the professor and numerous examples, algorithms and exercises will be reviewed. In computer classes, students will be provided with the necessary software to implement them and analyze the results. The courses will be complemented with conferences where invited proffesors will stimulate the curiosity of the students, showing recent research topics related with the matter.

After the end of the classroom days in Split, the students interested in evaluation to be recognized up to three credits, will deliver a final work in small groups related to the school topics. For this, they will be assisted by a final tutoring session.

\section{Evaluation}

Some students might be interested to be recognized for up to three credits. For that we have foreseen an evaluation process, which will be based on daily attendance to the school and  a small group work. It will be related to the school topics and will be delivered after the end of the classrom sessions.

\section{Travel and Accommodation}

{\color{myCOLOR}Sa\v sa, can you review ?}

The city of Split, Croatia, is served by an international airport which is located approximately 20 km from the city center of Split, on the west side of Kaštela Bay. Regular taxis at Split Airport are available during the airport operation times, being the average cab fare to the center of Split about 30\euro. Other options for travelling include Shuttle Bus (Pleso Prijevoz) and Local Bus, with respective costs of 6\euro. and 2.5\euro. 

The School will provide students with up to 20 places in the university residence located on the university campus, a 5-minute walk from the faculty of science, where the activities will take place. Breakfast and lunch are included.
