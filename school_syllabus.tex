\section{Overview}

This school is aimed at young students looking to acquire skills on the most trending techniques in mathematical and computational modeling. We place a strong emphasis in practical applications in science and engineering, with a focus on modeling spatiotemporal variations of physical quantities using partial differential equations (PDEs). And related topics such as numerical optimization, playing a vital role today in fields like deep learning.

The school is structured into three courses. 
Two of them cover the widely used finite element method (FEM) and other emerging techniques such as physically informed neural networks (PINN) for computing numerical solutions of PDEs.
A third course focus on numerical methods for constrained and unconstrained optimization. 
In these courses, we introduce fundamental math structures, provide illustrative examples, review algorithms, program them with high-level open-source tools, and post-process the solutions for high-quality plotting.

The necessary mathematical and computer skills will be standardized in introductory online sessions, with the entire learning process overseen by expert professors in the field.
The courses are complemented by some conferences where lecturers related to SEA-EU universities  introduce recent research projects related to the subjects of the School.

\section{Methodology}

The school begins with a phase dedicated to homogenizing the students' knowledge to help them reach a basic level before the classroom courses begin to develop in Split. It will be designed as 5 online days where students will be able to access material specifically prepared for them to acquire basic math and computer skills. During these days they will have the support and tutoring of the curses instructors, through video meetings and forums in a virtual campus.

In a second week, the School will be held physically on the premises of the University of Split. It will consist on three courses where  theoretical lectures will be given by the professor and numerous examples, algorithms and exercises will be reviewed. In computer classes, students will be provided with the necessary software to implement them and analyze the results. The courses will be complemented with conferences where invited professors will stimulate the curiosity of the students, showing recent research topics related with the matter.

After the end of the classroom days in Split, the students interested in evaluation to be recognized up to three credits, will deliver a final work in small groups related to the school topics. For this, they will be assisted by a final tutoring session.

\section{Evaluation}

Some students might be interested to be recognized for up to three credits. For that we have foreseen an evaluation process, which will be based on daily attendance to the school and  a small group work. It will be related to the school topics and will be delivered after the end of the classroom sessions.

\section{Travel and Accommodation}

{\color{myCOLOR}Sa\v sa, can you review ?}

The city of Split, Croatia, is served by an international airport which is located approximately 20 km from the city center of Split, on the west side of Kaštela Bay. Regular taxis at Split Airport are available during the airport operation times, being the average cab fare to the center of Split about 30\euro. Other options for travelling include Shuttle Bus (Pleso Prijevoz) and Local Bus, with respective costs of 6\euro. and 2.5\euro. 

The School will provide students with up to 20 places in the university residence located on the university campus, a 5-minute walk from the faculty of science, where the activities will take place. Breakfast and lunch are included.

\section{Erasmus Funding}

{\color{myCOLOR}Sa\v sa, can you review ?}

Up to 20 Students coming from a EU Member State or third country associated to the Erasmus+ program can apply for funding through  Blended Intensive Program (BIP). This will allow them to get support to attend the classroom week in Split.
