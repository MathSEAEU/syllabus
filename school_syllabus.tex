Not only are they abundant, but they've diversified into an extraordinary array of sizes, shapes, lifestyles, and habitats.

\qOne{Do we need deep skills in Mathematics?}
\aOne{Yes, we do actually dissect fish. If you know of any issues that may cause you difficulties during dissections, please notify your TA ASAP.}

\qTwo{Do we need deep skills in Computer Programming?}
\aTwo{No clue. When someone says `fish', we have a picture of a general fish of a general shape in our minds, but the truth is that `fish' doesn't have scientific meaning. Here's a funny video about that: \href{https://youtu.be/uhwcEvMJz1Y}{Youtube (hyperlink)}. }

\qThree{What is your favorite fish?}
\aThree{A lumpsucker. They are incredibly, adorably weird-looking.}

\qFour{What's the difference between plural `fish' and `fishes'?}
\aFour{`Fish' is the plural form when talking about two or more fish of the same species. `Fishes' is the plural when talking about two or more different species.}

\section{Overview}
 
This school is devoted to introducing young students interested in mathematical and computational modeling into some of the most trending techniques being used today in this field. With special interest in practical application to science and engineering of models formulated in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs).

It is structured around three courses. Two of them focus on computing numerical solutions of PDEs. The widely used finite element method (FEM) will be studied along to other emerging techniques such as physically informed neural networks (PINN).
Numerical methods for constrained and unconstrained optimization will also be covered in a third course. 
%The school will be structured around three courses. where, in order to approach the solution of PDEs we will combine some of the most successful techniques used in the last years and other emerging techniques such as physically informed neural networks.
Throgh several examples and using high level open source computer tools, we explore algorithms for optimization, formulate and solve numerically PDE models and post-process the solutions for high-quality plotting. 

The required mathematical and computer skills will be standarized in introductory online sessions and the entire learning process will be supervised by professors who are experts in this field. 
The courses are complemented by some conferences where lecturers related to SEA-EU universities show introduce recent research projects related to the subjects of the School.

%It will be structured around three courses where some of the some of the more succesful techniques    the  variational formulation of PDEs and the Finite Element Method (FEM). Using high level open source computer tools, we explore techniques for meshing of spatial domains, numerical solving of systems of equations and post-processing the solutions with high-quality visualization engines. The required mathematical and computer skills will be standardized in the first introductory sessions.

%Topics like thermal diffusion, linear or nonlinear elasticity, migration of biological cells, fluid dynamics in oceanography or naval engineering and many other matters of practical interest will be covered.
%The course is complemented by some conferences in which lecturers related to SEA-EU universities show their experience in recent research projects related to these subjects.
